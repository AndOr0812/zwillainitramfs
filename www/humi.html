Humidity level<br>
<br>
Maintaining proper humidity levels in the computer room is essential
for reliable equipment performance. <br>
Humidity levels outside the recommended range of 25% to 45%, especially
if these levels are sustained, lead <br>
to equipment damage and result in equipment malfunction through several
mechanisms.<br>
<br>
High humidity levels enable galvanic activity to occur between
dissimilar metals. Galvanic activity can cause <br>
high resistance to develop between connections and lead to equipment
malfunctions and failures. Extended <br>
periods of humidity levels greater than 60% have also been shown to
adversely affect modern printed circuit <br>
board reliability. High humidity can also adversely affect some
magnetic tapes and paper media.<br>
High humidity levels are often the result of malfunctioning facility
air conditioning systems<br>
<br>
High humidity can&nbsp; also be the result of facility expansion in
excess of air conditioning system capacity.<br>
Humidity levels below the minimum recommended value can also have
undesirable effects. Low humidity <br>
contributes to high ESD voltage potentials. ESD events can cause
component damage during service <br>
operations and equipment malfunction or damage during normal operation.
Low humidity levels can reduce <br>
the effectiveness of static dissipating materials and have also been
shown to cause high speed printer p<br>
aper feed problems.<br>
<br>
Low humidity levels are often the result of the facility heating system
and occur during the cold season. Most <br>
heating systems cause air to have a low humidity level, unless the
system has a built-in humidifier.<br>
IT equipment manufacturers recommend a range of 18°C dry bulb with a <br>
5.5°C dew point temperature to 27°C dry bulb with a 5.5°C dew point
temperature. Over this range of dry <br>
bulb temperature with a 5.5°C dew point, the relative humidity varies
from approximately 25% to 45%.<br>
